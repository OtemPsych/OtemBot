# OtemBot

An educational project that uses a Discord bot that can play music in a voice channel by providing a query to search and play a YouTube video, or by directly providing a YouTube/SoundCloud/Spotify URL. This bot uses [Discord.js 14](https://discord.js.org/) and [DisTube.js](https://distube.js.org/#/) to provide music playback in a Discord server.

## Features

* Play music from YouTube, SoundCloud or Spotify.
* Queue up multiple songs and manage the playback.
* Volume control to adjust the bot's volume in the voice channel.
* Skip, pause, resume and stop playback.
* Seek to a specific timestamp in the song.
* Shuffle the enqueued songs.

## Commands

* `/disconnect`: Disconnects the bot from the voice channel.
* `/help`: Lists all commands available.
* `/pause`: Pauses the current song.
* `/play <query>`: Plays a song by providing a query or a URL.
* `/playskip <query>`: Skips the current song and starts playing another one by providing a query or a URL.
* `/previous`: Plays the previous song in the queue.
* `/queue`: Shows the queued songs.
* `/resume`: Resumes the paused song.
* `/seek <timestamp>`: Jumps to a specific time in the song.
* `/shuffle`: Shuffles the songs in the queue.
* `/skip`: Skips to the next song in the queue.
* `/song`: Shows the song currently playing.
* `/stop`: Stops playing the current song and removes all songs from the queue.
* `/volume <volume>`: Sets the bot's volume for the server.
